Determine Business Objectives
The College Ventures Network is a network of student-run startup accelerators and venture capital funds. It brings together 30+ organizations across the globe to share resources, advice, and “support the entrepreneurial ecosystems of college campuses across the world”. 
The event that we are promoting is a “one-day virtual and in-person conference created by the largest consortium of student accelerators, student venture funds, and student venture organizations.The CVN Conference is designed for young founders, VCs, and operators to learn from the brightest and most successful minds in the entrepreneurial ecosystem.The conference takes place on April 15th 2022 and features a variety of keynote speakers presenting on entrepreneurship.” 
The business objective in our situation is to determine if running ads on Facebook is an effective method of increasing click-through rates of the website as well as increasing attendees. This is our goal because we want to bring as much attention to the website as possible in the hopes of increasing members in CVN. 
A successful project will let us know whether ads are truly useful in obtaining our business objectives and how useful they are as well. We will be judging that collectively and determining if we can make conclusive insights from our data. Further an extremely successful project will let us know further steps we can take to improve the click through rate of CVN’s website.
