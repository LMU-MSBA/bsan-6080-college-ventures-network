Determine Business Objectives
The College Ventures Network is a network of student-run startup accelerators and venture capital funds. It brings together 30+ organizations across the globe to share resources, advice, and “support the entrepreneurial ecosystems of college campuses across the world”. 
The event that we are promoting is a “one-day virtual and in-person conference created by the largest consortium of student accelerators, student venture funds, and student venture organizations.The CVN Conference is designed for young founders, VCs, and operators to learn from the brightest and most successful minds in the entrepreneurial ecosystem.The conference takes place on April 15th 2022 and features a variety of keynote speakers presenting on entrepreneurship.” 
The business objective in our situation is to determine if running ads on Facebook is an effective method of increasing click-through rates of the website as well as increasing attendees. This is our goal because we want to bring as much attention to the website as possible in the hopes of increasing members in CVN. 
A successful project will let us know whether ads are truly useful in obtaining our business objectives and how useful they are as well. We will be judging that collectively and determining if we can make conclusive insights from our data. Further an extremely successful project will let us know further steps we can take to improve the click through rate of CVN’s website.

Legal issues.
Permission obtained to use their data
Assumptions. Used to verify the validity of results
Analytics have never been run before on the ad campaigns
The insight obtained could be helpful in understanding how traction of the conference
Constraints
Availability of resources
Only working predominantly on 1 social media platform (Twitter)
No Analytics department at the organization. 
Technological constraints

Risks and Contingencies
Risks that might cause the project to delay or fail
Running Campaigns very close to the Conference deadline

List all the contingency plans for each risk 
Ads are being run on platform for CVN already has a significant presence
We are hopeful that by running ads closer to the deadline that will stream in more interest in the event
Terminology
Relevant terminology to the project
Glossary of business terminology
Increased attendance to the event on April 15th, 2022 
Increased revenue $ (VC funders)
Increased visibility of the College Ventures Network
Glossary of data mining terminology
CPC - Cost Per Click: a paid advertising term where an advertiser pays a cost to a publisher for every click on an ad. 
CPM - Cost Per Minute: the total cost a project or goal takes per minute of time
Conversion Rate:  records the percentage of users who have completed a desired action.
Click Through Rate: the number of clicks that your ad receives divided by the number of times your ad is shown:
 Clicks ÷ Impressions = CTR
Cost and Benefits
Costs of the project vs. potential benefits if successful
Major Cost: Payment for running Ads on Twitter & resources to run the ad analytics
Major Benefit: More visibility, greater promotion of CVN events.





Determine Data Mining Goals
Data Mining Goals are directly related to our main business goal
Business Goal: Assess the effectiveness of Facebook ads for increasing clickthrough rates and event RSVPs 
Data Mining Goal translation: accurately track and visualize key performance indicators such as clickthrough funnel rate, average engagement, and number of event RSVPs
Determine Data MIning Success Criteria
We will be successful with this data mining goal if we are able to produce a user friendly dashboard which can be transferred over to the College Ventures Network social media team

Produce Project Plan
Determine Expected Duration of Each Stage of the Project 
Our expected duration for each section of the project will be 2 weeks. Our data understanding will have an expected completion date of April 12, 2022. Our Data preparation, modeling, and evaluation will have an expected completion date of April 26 with our data preparation taking 4 days, our modeling taking 5 days, and our evaluation taking 5 days. Lastly, our deployment will have an expected duration of 2 weeks with a completion date expected around May 3.

Determine dependencies of each stage of project
Data Understanding Stage:
Dependencies needed during the data understanding stage will be a list of data sources, methodology on how to acquire the data.  In order for this to happen we will need to have an understanding of how Facebook advertisements work. 
Data Preparation Stage:
During this stage the primary dependencies are based on how many datasets we utilize for our final product.  We can look into previous campaigns on Facebook that have historically been successful and see which factors can go into making ours successful as well.  We will also need to clean the data during this stage.
Data Modeling Stage:
Before we continue with modeling we need to assume that there are not any missing values, all class attributes are taken into account.  Essentially we will need to clean the data from the preparation stage before moving forward in our modeling stage. 
Data Evaluation Stage:
We have a resource based dependency during our data evaluation stage.  In order for us to proceed through this stage there needs to be all our data models for evaluation as well as the original datasets for reference. 
Deployment Stage:
Before deployment, all previous stages are required.  Everything must be prepared appropriately from the Facebook Campaign, to data modeling tools, as well as what types of variables the team is looking for to showcase significance/success.
Assess of tools and techniques necessary throughout project
Data Understanding Stage:
Facebook Advertising interface will be necessary in collecting the initial data.  Potentially could also look into google doc surveys but will most likely be relying on the Facebook Advertising interface. 
Data Preparation Stage:
Once we collect the data from our Facebook Advertising campaign we will need to use SQL, Excel, and Python to prepare the data for the modeling stage
Data Modeling Stage:
Tableau will be necessary during the modeling stage for visualizations.  Excel can also be utilized during this stage for more basic graphs.
Data Evaluation Stage:
For the Data evaluation stage we can use R, Excel, or Python in order to evaluate the data using varying techniques to showcase significance.  Examples could be regression lines, chi square tests, linear regression predictive models.
Deployment Stage:
Proper documentation on how to deploy a future advertising.
